# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 5th, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on database interaction.

**Thoughts:** It's a constant debate about what goes in the SQLiteHelper vs. what goes in the DataSource class.

### Day 1: January 6th, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: More database work on my app.

**Thoughts:** I'm really interested in seeing how well things work when I test it.

### Day 2: January 7th, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Started testing my database work.

**Thoughts:** I need to improve my database testing chops, but the app still works so that's good.

### Day 3: January 8th, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Continued testing my database work.

**Thoughts:** It was very exciting to see that the database is working correctly. Stress testing is next...

**Link to work:** No new commit - see above links.


### Day 4: January 9th, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Revised my method for getting the *day* of the year to get the *second* instead. (For faster testing.)

**Thoughts:** Next is adding some unit tests and perhaps some mocking - the latter will be new, exciting, and possibly daunting. Until I do it - then it will just be cool.
