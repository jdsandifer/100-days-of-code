# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 5th, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on database interaction.

**Thoughts:** It's a constant debate about what goes in the SQLiteHelper vs. what goes in the DataSource class.

### Day 1: January 6th, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: More database work on my app.

**Thoughts:** I'm really interested in seeing how well things work when I test it.

### Day 2: January 7th, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Started testing my database work.

**Thoughts:** I need to improve my database testing chops, but the app still works so that's good.

### Day 3: January 8th, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Continued testing my database work.

**Thoughts:** It was very exciting to see that the database is working correctly. Stress testing is next...

**Link to work:** No new commit - see above links.


### Day 4: January 9th, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Revised my method for getting the *day* of the year to get the *seconds* instead. (for faster testing)

**Thoughts:** Next is adding some unit tests and perhaps some mocking - the latter will be new, exciting, and possibly daunting. Until I do it - then it will just be cool.

### Day 5: January 14th, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress:** Today I practiced basic techniques for concurrency in vanilla Java. I'm starting a complete refresher on all of the possibilities and pitfalls to avoid so I'm better able to implement concurrency when it's applicable.

**Thoughts:** Had a few busy days and didn't get to coding so I have a gap in my 100 days. I think that'll be ok if I can get back on track. 100 days of coding will still be helpful even if it's not completely sequential.

**Link to work:** [Concurrency.java](https://github.com/jdsandifer/HackerRank/blob/master/Java/Concurrency.java)


### Day 6 - 8: Not Logged

**Progress:** I answered questions on Treehouse for both Android and Java on three different days. 

**Thoughts:** I realized that although this isn't work on projects, it is related to preparing for an interview and a job in development. Thinking quickly, discussing my approaches and solutions to problems, and helping coworkers will all be important for landing and keepiing a development position. So I'm going to allow it.


### Day 9: January 24th, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on making the graph in my app correctly display real data - instead of my stand-in values. Converted my weight record to a singleton for easy global access and because it makes sense for it to be one.

**Thoughts:** Still in progress...app is freezing after initial load now. Singleton code seems like the obvious source, but the app gets past the initialization of it and freezes later...


### Day 10 & 11: January 25th & 26th, 2017 (Wednesday & Thursday)

**Today's Progress:** Answered more questions on Treehouse about Java.

**Thoughts:** I do want to make sure my question answering isn't keeping me from progressing on my apps, but it's a great way to stay actively thinking about Java and Android without having to get my development computer up and running. This probably means I need to get Android Studio working on my laptop so working on projects is as easy as answering questions...
